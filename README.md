# blog_hv
An attempt at writing my first hypervisor from scratch, building upon the kernel development introduction of blog_os (see https://os.phil-opp.com/).

Run with `cargo run --bin qemu-bios` or `cargo run --bin qemu-uefi`

Note: blog_os used legacy devices for educational purposes, so qemu-uefi may have unimplemented functionality.
